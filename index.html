                                  Hello, I am Devon, and I am a passionate programmer.  I graduate from Portland State University June of 2021.  I chose software engineering because I love problem solving, I love being challenged and I often find myself filled with curiosity surrounding the growing amount of technology around us and how it works. Software engineering gives me fullfillment that way.  I constantly find myself excited by new challenges and learning more about technology.  When I am away from my keyboard I might be taking photos and hiking outdoors(below is a photo of me at yellowstone) or skating through the city.&#128512;

                               <p>
                                  This was the first project that led to me realizing that this was something I could do for a living.  The reason I realized that was because once I got to the tough part of this program I could not stop working on it until it was done.  I would work on it until I went to bed and it was the first thing I would do when I woke up.  I enjoyed writing this program.  This is a program that asks the user for a 3CNF and produces a truth table for that expression of any size.  Not knowing the size of the table ahead of time was part of what made this such a challenging program to write.

                                   The first big project I did was ChocoAn.  You can log in as a provider or a manager and the app keeps track of patients, providers and managers.  The manager/provider can do things like access patient records, create patient records, access the provider directory and generate bills.  I worked with a few other students on this project.  It was my first time working with Java and I enjoyed how much easier Java was than C++ but I also enjoyed the challenge of learning how to use a new language.  This was also the first project that took a substantial amount of time to complete, which ended up being a month and a half long.  T

                                       I referenced this project because I thought it was an interesting one to talk about and present.  This project gave me the opportunity to get my feet wet in 3-D programming using OpenGL and C++.  This is a very simple program that renders a 3-D object.

                                           My last project as a studentis going to be for my first real world client, it is a 6 month project with a few other students who are also seniors approaching graduation.  This project is currently in progress but has a firm deadline of June 6 of 2021.  Gresham Golf Course needed an app that could digitize the paper system that they used to organize, archive, and present all information relating to the chemical applications used on the course.  This application will make the process of keeping track of the chemical applications simpler and quicker while making sure that OSHA guidelines are met.

                                    I worked on developing a website for Visa Confidence.  This was when I got my first experience with full stack development.  I was exposed to the inner workings of the client server relationship.

                                    I recieved the grades necessary in order to be able to help tutor students who also were studying computer science below me.  This provided me with the experience I needed in order to understand how well you need to understand something in order to be able to teach it.  This provided me the opportunity to take what I have learned and understand as well as I believe I possibly can.  It also gave me the opportunity to work with others on programming excercises.

                                   While I was in school and shortly before I started I got a job at a dental office.  While I was there I took the x-ray course and got certified to take x-rays in the state of oregon.  I worked closely with seniors which taught me how to meet the needs of any person.
