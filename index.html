                                  I am Devon, and I am an extremely passionate CS graduate.  I graduate from Portland State University June of 2021.  I chose software engineering because I love problem solving, I love being challenged and I often find myself thinking about the growing amount of technology around us and how they work. Software engineering how fulfilled all of those things around me.  I constantly find myself excited by new challenges and learning more about the technology around me.  When I am away from my keyboard I might be taking photos and hiking outdoors, below is a photo of me at yellowstone, or skating in the city.&#128512;

                                       I have been practicing web development during my free time, I knew how to use html and css but recently I started learning how to use javascript, jQuery and bootsrap to make web development faster and easier as well as learn how to make responsive and interactive webpages.

                                    I worked on developing a website for Visa Confidence.  This was when I got my first experience with full stack development.  I was exposed to the inner workings of the client server relationship.

                                    I recieved the grades necessary in order to be able to help tutor students who also were studying computer science below me.  This provided me with the experience I needed in order to understand how well you need to understand something in order to be able to teach it.  This provided me the opportunity to take what I have learned and understand as well as I believe I possibly can.  It also gave me the opportunity to work with others on programming excercises.

                                <p>
                                   While I was in school and shortly before I started I got a job at a dental office.  While I was there I took the x-ray course and got certified to take x-rays in the state of oregon.  I worked closely with seniors which taught me how to meet the needs of any person.
